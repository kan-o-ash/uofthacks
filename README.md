# uofthacks-homehelp
HomeHelp is a platform that brings communities together. With it, we aim to humanize the underprivileged through their stories and their service. Find the less fortunate living in your area, read their stories, and build your communities together - HomeHelp enables you to reach out and offer short-term work and wage to those who, through their invisibility, may not have been able to earn it otherwise. Work together. Live together. Grow together.
